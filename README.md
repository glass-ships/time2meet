# When2meet / WhenIsGood Alternative


## What is this?

This is a simple web app that allows you to create a poll for people to vote on when they are available.  
It is similar to [When2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/) and [WhenIsGood](https://whenisgood.net/), but it is open source and self-hosted.


## Design Goals

- Modern, responsive UI (using [React](https://reactjs.org/)) with TypeScript
- Easy to use and understand
- Mobile friendly (using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/))


## Features

- [ ] Create a poll with optional title and description
- [ ] Create a poll with a set/range of dates and times
- [ ] Users/organizers can specify a timezone (default grabbed from browser)
- [ ] Users can indicate times they are available (or preferred?)
- [ ] Users can use their name and a 4-digit pin to edit their availability
- [ ] Users can leave comments (maybe?)
